# Project Notes

## Google Keep Competitor Idea
- Goal: Build a competitor to Google Keep.
- Features:
  - Track tasks
  - Assign due dates to tasks
  - Add tags to tasks
  - Add ability to share tasks
  - Highlight overdue tasks (e.g., turn red after due date)
  - Send notification when a task is overdue
- Tech Stack:
  - Frontend: Next.js
  - Backend: Hono

## Out of Scope
- Advanced database performance optimizations
- Complex database engines (using simple SQLite for now)
- Deep database engineering (team lacks dedicated DB engineers)

## User Interaction & Design
- Users interact via standard forms
- On page load, focus is on an input box for quick task creation
- Users type and hit enter to create a task
- Diagrams and advanced UI/UX to be considered later

## Definition of Done (MVP)
- Can create, edit, and delete tasks
- Can make a to-do public and share it
