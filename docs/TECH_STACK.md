# Tech Stack Documentation

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

This tech stack is for building a Google Keep competitor - a task management application that allows users to create, organize, and share tasks effectively. The project aims to provide core functionality including task tracking, due date management, tagging, task sharing capabilities, overdue task highlighting, and notification systems.

The primary goals influencing technology choices are:
- Speed of development (using familiar frameworks like Next.js)
- Simplicity and maintainability (avoiding complex database solutions due to team constraints)
- Team expertise alignment (leveraging existing knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem)
- MVP-focused approach (prioritizing essential features over advanced optimizations)

## 2. Core Languages & Runtimes

The primary programming language for both frontend and backend will be TypeScript/JavaScript, leveraging the Node.js ecosystem for consistency and team expertise.

Frontend: TypeScript with React (via Next.js framework) for type safety and modern development practices.

Backend: TypeScript with Hono framework running on Node.js runtime for API development.

The choice of JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack enables code sharing, reduces context switching for developers, and leverages the rich ecosystem of npm packages.

## 3. Frameworks & Libraries (Backend)

Backend framework: Hono - a lightweight, fast web framework chosen for its simplicity and performance characteristics, suitable for building REST APIs efficiently.

Key backend libraries will include:
- Database interaction: SQLite driver for simple data persistence
- API documentation: To be determined based on Hono ecosystem
- Authentication/authorization: To be implemented as needed for task sharing features

## 4. Frameworks & Libraries (Frontend)

Frontend framework: Next.js - chosen for its React-based architecture, built-in routing, server-side rendering capabilities, and excellent developer experience for building modern web applications.

Key frontend libraries:
- UI framework: React (included with Next.js)
- Styling: To be determined (likely CSS modules or styled-components)
- State management: React built-in state management (useState, useContext) for MVP simplicity
- Form handling: Standard HTML forms as specified in requirements

## 5. Database & Data Storage

Database type: Relational database using SQLite for simplicity and ease of deployment.

SQLite was specifically chosen because:
- The team lacks dedicated database engineers
- Complex database engines are explicitly out of scope
- SQLite provides sufficient functionality for the MVP requirements
- No advanced database performance optimizations are needed initially

The database will store tasks with properties including content, due dates, tags, sharing status, and completion state.

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment

<!-- TODO: Where will the application be hosted (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, Vercel, Netlify, on-premise)? What specific services will be used? What containerization technologies will be used? What CI/CD tools and processes are planned? -->

## 7. APIs & Integrations

The project will expose REST APIs built with the Hono framework to support:
- Task CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Task sharing functionality
- Due date and tag management
- Overdue task identification

API style: REST architecture for simplicity and standard HTTP methods.

Third-party integrations will include:
- Notification services for overdue task alerts (specific service to be determined)

<!-- TODO: What critical third-party services or APIs will be integrated for payment, identity, analytics, or communication services? -->

## 8. Development Tools & Standards

Version control: Git (repository hosting platform to be determined)

Development approach:
- Standard forms for user interaction
- Focus on input box for quick task creation on page load
- Enter key functionality for task creation
- Web-based interface accessible through browsers

Testing frameworks and strategies will be implemented to ensure:
- Task creation, editing, and deletion functionality
- Public task sharing capabilities
- Core MVP requirements validation

<!-- TODO: Are there specific IDEs, linters, or code formatting standards? What specific testing frameworks will be employed? -->

## 9. Security Considerations

Security requirements for task sharing functionality:
- Secure task sharing mechanisms to control public access
- Input validation for task content and metadata
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

<!-- TODO: What are the key security requirements for the chosen technologies? Are there specific libraries, tools, or practices for authentication, authorization, input validation, data encryption, dependency scanning, or secrets management? -->

## 10. Rationale & Alternatives Considered

**Next.js for Frontend:**
- Rationale: Mature React framework with excellent developer experience, built-in routing, and SSR capabilities
- Alternatives considered: Plain React, Vue.js, Angular (Next.js chosen for its comprehensive feature set and React ecosystem)

**Hono for Backend:**
- Rationale: Lightweight, fast framework suitable for building REST APIs with minimal overhead
- Alternatives considered: Express.js, Fastify, NestJS (Hono chosen for its simplicity and performance)

**SQLite for Database:**
- Rationale: Explicitly chosen for simplicity due to team constraints and lack of dedicated database engineers
- Alternatives considered: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB (SQLite chosen to avoid complex database engineering requirements)

**TypeScript/JavaScript Stack:**
- Rationale: Enables full-stack development with single language, rich ecosystem, team familiarity
- Alternatives considered: Python/Django, Java/Spring, C#/.NET (JavaScript chosen for development speed and team expertise)
