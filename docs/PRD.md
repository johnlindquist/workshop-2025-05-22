## 1. Core Functionality & Purpose
- The primary problem this product solves is providing a platform for users to manage their tasks effectively, similar to Google Keep.
- Core functionality includes tracking tasks, assigning due dates, adding tags, sharing tasks, highlighting overdue tasks, and sending notifications for overdue tasks.

## 2. Key Goals & Scope
- Critical objectives include building a functional Google Keep competitor with the specified features.
- Items explicitly out-of-scope for the current development cycle or version:
    - Advanced database performance optimizations
    - Complex database engines (using simple SQLite for now)
    - Deep database engineering (team lacks dedicated DB engineers)

## 3. User Interaction & Design Insights
- The primary user type is a web application user.
- Users will interact with the core features through a Next.js frontend.
- Users interact via standard forms.
- On page load, focus is on an input box for quick task creation.
- Users type and hit enter to create a task.
- <!-- TODO: Describe the primary ways users will interact with the core features (reference UI mockups, API contracts, user flow diagrams if available in NOTES.md or linked external resources). (Expected in NOTES.md - Diagrams and advanced UI/UX to be considered later) -->

## 4. Essential Features & Implementation Highlights
- Must-have functionalities:
  - Track tasks
  - Assign due dates to tasks
  - Add tags to tasks
  - Add ability to share tasks
  - Highlight overdue tasks
  - Send notification when a task is overdue
- High-level implementation considerations:
  - Frontend: Next.js
  - Backend: Hono

## 5. Acceptance Criteria & Definition of "Done"
- For the MVP:
    - Can create, edit, and delete tasks
    - Can make a to-do public and share it
- <!-- TODO: For each key feature or user story, what are the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) conditions that must be met for it to be considered "done"? (Expected in NOTES.md - beyond MVP) -->
- <!-- TODO: How will successful completion be verified (e.g., specific tests, user validation scenarios)? (Expected in NOTES.md) -->

## 6. Key Requirements & Constraints
- Technical requirements:
  - Frontend: Next.js
  - Backend: Hono
  - Database: Simple SQLite
- Constraints:
  - Team lacks dedicated DB engineers, so complex database solutions are out of scope.
- <!-- TODO: List key non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as performance targets (latency, throughput), scalability needs, security standards (compliance, data privacy), reliability goals (uptime), and any known constraints (e.g., infrastructure limitations, budget, timelines). (Expected in NOTES.md) -->

## 7. Success Metrics
- <!-- TODO: How will the success of this product/feature be measured post-deployment from a user and business perspective (e.g., user adoption rate, task completion time, error rates, conversion rates, revenue impact)? (Expected in NOTES.md) -->
- <!-- TODO: (Optional, if distinct from above) How will the development team measure technical success (e.g., system stability, maintainability, code quality metrics)? (Expected in NOTES.md) -->

## 8. Development Logistics & Lookahead
- <!-- TODO: Identify significant technical risks, challenges, or dependencies. Include initial thoughts on mitigation strategies. (Expected in NOTES.md) -->
- <!-- TODO: List major assumptions being made that, if incorrect, could impact development. (Expected in NOTES.md) -->
- Current design choices should accommodate fitting the features together using Next.js for the frontend and Hono for the backend.
- Future development aspects: Diagrams and advanced UI/UX to be considered later.
- <!-- TODO: Briefly consider future development aspects or extensibility points that current design choices should accommodate. (Expected in NOTES.md - beyond UI/UX) -->
