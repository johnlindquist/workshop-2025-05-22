# Task: Fix ThemeProvider Integration and Resolve Build Errors

## Commit 1: feat: add missing theme-provider component and next-themes dependency âœ… 3b77dd5
**Description:**
The build is failing because `@/components/theme-provider` is imported in `apps/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` but the component doesn't exist. Based on the shadcn/ui configuration in `apps/frontend/components.json` and the ThemeProvider usage pattern, this appears to be a next-themes integration. I will create the missing `apps/frontend/src/components/theme-provider.tsx` component and add the required `next-themes` dependency to `apps/frontend/package.json`. The component will be a standard shadcn/ui theme provider wrapper that supports light/dark theme switching with proper TypeScript types.

**Verification:**
1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    *   **Command:** `pnpm --filter frontend build`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** `Build completes successfully without module resolution errors for @/components/theme-provider`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    *   **Action:** `pnpm --filter frontend dev` and navigate to localhost:3000
    *   **Expected Log:** `No console errors related to ThemeProvider, app loads successfully with theme context available`
    *   **Toggle Mechanism:** `Browser developer console (F12)`

## Commit 2: feat: create missing ui components directory structure for shadcn/ui
**Description:**
The project has shadcn/ui configured in `apps/frontend/components.json` with aliases pointing to `@/components/ui` but this directory structure doesn't exist yet. I will create the `apps/frontend/src/components/ui/` directory and add any missing base UI components that may be referenced by the existing components (`mobile-sidebar.tsx`, `note-card.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `top-bar.tsx`). I'll scan these files for any missing UI component imports and create stub components or install them via shadcn/ui CLI. This ensures the component ecosystem is complete and functional.

**Verification:**
1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    *   **Command:** `pnpm --filter frontend build && pnpm --filter frontend lint`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** `No TypeScript errors or missing module imports, all component dependencies resolved`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    *   **Action:** `Import and render each component in a test page to verify no runtime errors`
    *   **Expected Log:** `All components render without errors, no missing dependency warnings in console`
    *   **Toggle Mechanism:** `Browser developer console and Next.js development server logs`

## Commit 3: fix: update import paths and resolve any remaining component dependencies
**Description:**
After examining the unstaged changes, I need to ensure all import paths are correctly configured according to the TypeScript path mapping in `apps/frontend/tsconfig.json` (which uses `@/*` for `src/*`). I will review and fix any incorrect import statements in the modified files (`apps/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/app/globals.css`) and the new component files. I'll also verify that the Tailwind CSS configuration in `apps/frontend/tailwind.config.ts` is properly set up to work with the new components and styling approach.

**Verification:**
1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    *   **Command:** `pnpm --filter frontend build && pnpm --filter frontend start`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** `Production build succeeds and application starts without errors, all routes accessible`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    *   **Action:** `Navigate through the application and interact with all visible components`
    *   **Expected Log:** `No 404 errors for assets, no hydration mismatches, smooth theme transitions if theme switching is implemented`
    *   **Toggle Mechanism:** `Next.js server logs and browser network tab`

## Commit 4: test: add component integration tests and logging for theme functionality
**Description:**
To ensure the theme provider integration is robust and the designer's components work correctly, I will create integration tests in `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/` directory. Tests will cover theme provider context availability, component rendering with different themes, and proper CSS class application. I'll add structured logging using a logger configuration file `apps/frontend/src/lib/logger.ts` that can be toggled via environment variables. The logging will track theme changes, component mount/unmount cycles, and any runtime errors for debugging purposes.

**Verification:**
1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    *   **Command:** `pnpm --filter frontend test` (after setting up test framework in package.json)
    *   **Expected Outcome:** `All theme provider and component integration tests pass, coverage includes theme switching and component rendering scenarios`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    *   **Action:** `Set LOG_LEVEL=debug and perform theme switching operations`
    *   **Expected Log:** `Structured JSON logs showing theme state changes, component lifecycle events, and performance metrics`
    *   **Toggle Mechanism:** `LOG_LEVEL environment variable (debug, info, warn, error, off)`
